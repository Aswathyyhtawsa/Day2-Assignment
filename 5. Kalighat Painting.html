        Kalighat Painting or Bengal Pat developed around the 19th century Bengal in the neighborhood of Kali Temple in Calcutta, Bengal. These paintings, on cloth and pattas, at first depicted Gods and Goddesses, but then took a turn towards social reform. The art was characterized by flawless strokes, brushwork, and simple but bold drawings. With the power of art, it raised awareness about social conditions – from depicting rich zamindars drinking wine with women, to priests being shown with ‘unchaste’ women, to police babus being sloppy.
