        As the name suggests, the Mughal Paintings evolved during the Mughal Era. This painting style reflects a synthesis of Indian, Persian, and Islamic art styles. The art form captured the vast themes around battles, receptions, court scenes, hunting scenes, legendary stories, portraits, and wildlife. Victoria and Albert Museums in London have huge collections of Mughal paintings
