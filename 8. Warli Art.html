    <img src="./O.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Originated by the Warli tribes from the Western Ghats of India, Warli Art is 2500-year old which makes it one of the oldest art forms in India. These paintings are closely linked with the nature and social rituals of the Warli tribes.It is mainly the use of circles, triangles, and squares to form numerous shapes and depict daily life activities like hunting, harvest, weddings, festivals, fertility, dance, and more. What sets it apart is the human shape: a circle and two triangles. All the paintings are done on a red ochre or dark background, while the shapes are white in color. Warli Art has gained immense popularity and is painted on home furnishings, d√©cor, and murals.</p>
