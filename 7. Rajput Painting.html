        Flourishing in the 18th century in the royal courts of Rajputana, Rajput art forms captured the scenes from Ramayana and Mahabharata. The colors used for these paintings were extracted from gold, silver, precious stones, and plant sources. This wasnâ€™t an easy task and this lengthy process would sometimes even take weeks.
